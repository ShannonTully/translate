#### Translator

This is a translator that takes in a word or sentence of any language, consisting of letters, spaces, numbers and these special characters: `. , - _ ? ! ( ) :`, and translates it into a semi-pronounceable but unreadable version of the language.  The end translation was designed to easily be able to be converted back to legibility with ease to any person with a legend, but be difficult to write code for a computer to decipher it.

## Usage

To run the translator on some text first pull down the repository and navigate to the folder, then enter this command into your terminal.
`python translate.py text`

Example:
`python translate.py shannon`
Output:
`shkibobedobe`

You can easily create a terminal alias for this command with the path for 
the file. Mine is set up as `garble`.


## Application

This was originally made to be a quick and easy fake language creator for books and games.  Simple enter what is to be said in a known language and out pops something new for you to use.
