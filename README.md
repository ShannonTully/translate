#### Translator

This is a translator that takes in a word or sentence of any language, consisting of letters, spaces, and dashes, and translates it into a pronounceable but unreadable version of the language.  The end translation was designed to easily be able to be converted back to legibility with ease to any person with a legend, but be difficult to write code for a computer to decypher it.

## Usage

To run the translator on some text first pull down the repository and navigate to the folder, then enter this command into your terminal.
`python translate.py text`

Example:
`python translate.py shannon`
Output:
`shkibobedobe`
